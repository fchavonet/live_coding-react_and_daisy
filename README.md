# REACT and Daisy

## Description

This project was developed as part of a live coding session at Holberton School Toulouse.

The goal was to demonstrate how to quickly set up a React project using Vite, TailwindCSS, Lucide React, and DaisyUI, in order to build a simple and clean landing page within a very short time.

The chosen theme for this demonstration was a small presentation page about Holberton School, allowing students to see how to design, structure, and style a responsive page directly in React JSX.

After the live session (≈ 1 hour), the project was refined for an additional two hours to finalize a presentable version.

This project serves as a reference for beginners looking to understand the foundations of a React front-end workflow and how to use utility-first frameworks efficiently.

Watch the live coding sessions here:

- Live coding session (FR) - *Coming soon*.

## Objectives

- Show how to initialize and configure a React project using Vite.
- Introduce Lucide React for using modern and lightweight icons.
- Demonstrate the use of Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for rapid UI prototyping.
- Build a responsive landing page in just a few hours.
- Keep the code accessible, readable, and educational for newcomers.
